# Currency Converter Project
This gradle Java project contains the barebones structure for a currency converter project for you to finish.
The project contains a short simple rate-pairs.txt file with currency pairs in. The application should read in the 
currency pairs then identify the correct pair from the command line arguments and perform the transaction.

This project contains the very basics you need to guide and help you complete this task and a simple unit test 
which you can expand to verify that.

Start of by forking this repository to begin your implementation!

This project uses AssertJ for unit tests alongside JUnit 5
